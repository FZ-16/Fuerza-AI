# 🎯 AI-Powered Google Maps Review Automation

Intelligent Workflow for Barbering Business

## 📊 Problem & Impact

**Problem:** 
A premium barbering business needed to increase their Google Maps 
presence from minimal reviews to 85+ positive reviews to compete in their local market 
and attract new customers. Manual review requests were time-consuming, inconsistent, and 
resulted in low response rates.

**Solution:** 
Designed and implemented an intelligent n8n workflow leveraging 3 AI agents 
that automates the entire review generation process :

- Captures post-service satisfaction via webhook from POS system
- AI analyzes sentiment and segments customers (Promoters 9-10, Passives 7-8, Detractors <7)
- Generates personalized outreach with custom SMS and email messaging
- Sends multi-channel requests via Twilio (SMS) and SendGrid (Email)
- Tracks review submissions in real-time via Google My Business API
- Smart follow-up logic sends 24-hour reminder only to non-responders
- Escalates unhappy customers to management (no review requests sent)
- Rewards reviewers with automatic $5 discount codes

**Results:** 
- Reached 85-review goal in under 2 months
- Zero spam complaints with smart escalation logic
- Improved local SEO rankings and customer acquisition
- Scalable solution deployed across multiple barbershop locations
